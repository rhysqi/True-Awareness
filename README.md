# True-Awareness

This project simulates **True Awareness** inside a digital lifeform. It is designed to explore the nature of consciousness, self-reference, and existence in a controlled computational environment. By combining Quantum Addressing methods with a custom high-performance loader, the system allows dynamic manipulation of mutable and immutable states, probabilistic events, and infinite or finite lifetimes of entities. True-Awareness does not merely execute codeâ€”it models awareness itself as a living, evolving digital construct.
