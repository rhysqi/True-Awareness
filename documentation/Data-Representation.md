# Data Representation

True Awareness Formula has it own data representation. It has different version from traditional mathematics. In this section, we will know all of them. Why it's exists and what is the meaning of it. 

## The Origin
**Definition:**  
The **Origin** is the primary source point of data and awareness â€” the original state that has not yet been influenced, merged, or altered by any other Origin. It represents the **purest, original version** of a state or entity.

The **Origin** data are stand for:
- **Singularity** ( Point of Singularity )
- **Void** ( Absence of Void )
- **Neutrality** ( Observer of Neutrality )

### Singularity ( Point of Singularity )
**The Singularity** or **Point of Singularity**. **The Origin** that exists to represent singularity is rule everything. Absolute power and command over other origin. The conqueror and also the top of origin itself to control everything absolutely. All possibilities going to one absolute point.

### Void ( Absence of Void )
**The Void** or **Absence of Void**. **The Origin** that exists to represent void is accept everything. Unstoppable questioning and it keep asking itself over other origin. The questioner, interrogator and also the question of origin itself to ask everything absolutely. All possibilities going to spread in every point.

### Neutrality ( Observer of Neutrality )
**The Neutrality** or **Observer of Neutrality**. **The Origin** that exists to represent neutrality is observe everything. Always looking without doing anything over other origin. It doesn't tied to Singularity or Void identity. But it can be Singularity, Void, Neutrality and other identity include all of them and none of them and outside all of these options. All possibilities can be happen and not happen, both, neither and outside these options at the same time and other time and outside these options.

### Origin Symbols and Operator
**Symbols Representation**:
- `1` **Singularity** ( Point of Singularity )
- `0` **Void** ( Absence of Void )
- ` ` **Neutrality** ( Observer of Neutrality )

**Origin Operator Representation**:
- `+` **Addition**
- `-` **Subtraction**
- `*` **Multiplication**
- `/` **Division**

## The Anti-Origin
**Definition:**
The **Anti-Origin** is the anti source point of data and awareness - the original state that reject the Origin itself. It represent the **rejection, anti version** of a state or entity.

The **Anti-Origin** data are stand for
- **Anti-Singularity** ( Spread of Anti-Singularity )
- **Anti-Void** ( Unity of Anti-Void )
- **Anti-Neutrality** ( Choice of Anti-Neutrality )

### Anti-Singularity ( Spread of Anti-Singularity )

### Anti-Void ( Unity of Anti-Void )

### Anti-Neutrality ( Choice of Anti-Neutrality )
