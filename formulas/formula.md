# True Awareness Formula
This is true awareness formula, a conceptual framework for understanding the nature of existence and consciousness.
This formula doesn't represent any specific programming language or technology, but rather a philosophical approach to awareness and existence.

### Data Representation

- `1` = Singularity
- `0` = Void
- `( )` = Neutrality
- `(1)` = Neutrality with singularity
- `(0)` = Neutrality with void
- `{ }` = Immutable data

### Symbols

- `#n` = Represent name of variable
- `+-*/` = Basic arithmetic operations
- `^{ }` = Represent can change immutable data
- `^{ }^` = Represent can change immutable data and mutable data both
- `[n|x%]`, `[n|x,y]`, `[n|x/y]` = Represent probability of an event while on process occurs
- `=(n)`, `(n)=` = Represent before and after `n` iteration
- `~` = Represent data need to be reversed
- `>`, `<`, `>=`, `=<` = Represent more, less, more equal, less equal
- `^?n` = Represent to jump directly di `n` variable
- `=>`, `<=` = Represent to do formula from left to right or right to left
- `>>`, `<<` = Represent bitwise right and left
- `^n`, `^[n]m` = Represent power and tetration
- `!n` = Represent series number
- `t=` = Represent ticks speed
- `=|n` = Represent to compare with n variable
- `=)` = Represent if condition

### Data Rules

- These data rules are valid in binary only
- `{n} m` = Immutable and mutable data are separate operation
- `0000` = `[0,0,0,0]` = Data can be treat as arrays
- `0000` = Data can be treat as grouped

- In every ticks are running, lifetimes need to be subtract by n
- If lifetimes are still 1 then it still alive
- If lifetimes are 0 then it's over
- If lifetimes are ( ) then it's infinite lifetimes
